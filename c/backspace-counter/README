The DBus session service is registered with the name "org.geekpur.vishal.BKD".
It has only one read-only method implemented called "GetBackspaceCount" which
returns the number of times user has pressed backspace key.

Since the service reads events from /dev/input/eventX file, it requires the
super user privileges. To do so, the application uses the setuid() call and
thus requiring the special capabilities; which should be achieved by running
following command:

$ sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep bkd-dbus-service

The DBus session service is registered with the name "org.geekpur.vishal.BKD".
It has only one read-only method implemented called "GetBackspaceCount" which
returns the number of times user has pressed backspace key.

Since the service reads events from /dev/input/eventX file, it requires the
super user privileges. To do so, the application uses the setuid() call and
thus requiring the special capabilities; which should be achieved by running
following command:

$ sudo setcap cap_setuid+ep bkd-dbus-service

NOTE:
Currently the source code uses the "/dev/input/event4" as the hard-coded
input file which must be changed as per input event device node on the
running computer. The code to auto detect the input event file is yet
to be added.

######## Breakpad QuickStart

1. Compile source code with -g option and generate executable/library
2. Run dump_syms on the generated object file (exe or lib)
3. Step 2 will dump symbols on stdout, store it in .sym file
4. do "head -n1" on .sym file
5. Extract the HASH from the step 4, and create a directory with following file
structure:
 ./symbols/<lib/exe>/<hash>/
6. Copy the .sym file generated at step 2 to above directory structure
7. Strip the exe/lib to remove debugging information
8. Run exe/lib which causes the crash, it will generate a dump file
9. Run minidump_stackwalk <dump-file> <symbol-path>
